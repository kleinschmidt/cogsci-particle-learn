** TODO Report three-components (run3)
** Alternative measures for success
*** TODO Entropy-based measure 
    (avg. entropy over particles?)
*** TODO Component weight cutoff
    based on Toscano and McMurray...
*** TODO confusion-matrix based
    have the "true" confusion matrix from the simulated data; can calculate
    p(same) for every pair from particles and compare.
** TODO Fix one-particle version
** TODO Run on raw VOT dists?
* Followup
** Allow component merging
   In rejuvination step?
